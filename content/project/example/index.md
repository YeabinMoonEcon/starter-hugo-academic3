title: Effects of Entry Economic Conditions on the Career of Economics Ph.D.
summary: I estimate the effect of entry economic conditions on the careers of economics Ph.D. recipients from the top 32 programs in the U.S. graduated between 2004 and 2012. I use natural language processing (NLP) to match degree holders with the career information scraped from various data sources. Exploiting the almost complete employment histories of the economists, I build a model based on task-specific human capital theory to examine the possible mechanisms driving the permanent effect on their careers caused by the entry conditions. I empirically test the model's predictions using nearly complete employment histories and find that entry conditions cause an occupational mismatch at graduation. Poor entry conditions are associated with a decreased probability of getting a full-time position in an R1 university in the U.S. both in the short run and long run. I also find that an increase in 1 standard deviation in unemployment rate (2.04 percentage point) at graduation would result in 2.31 percent fewer publications. The primary mechanism through which entry conditions have a long-term effect is immobility across occupations.
