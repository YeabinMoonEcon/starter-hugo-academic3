My name is Yeabin Moon. I am a PhD Candidate in the Economics Department at University of Houston. In my research, I use large-scale scraping and matching methods to study the effects of entry economic conditions on the economists' career. I am on the job market and will be available for interviews at the 2022 ASSA Meetings.
