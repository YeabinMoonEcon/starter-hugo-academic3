title: Characterizing Survey Response: Estimating Cognitive Proxy

summary: This paper examines the response behavior in the popular survey. There is a growing interest in the cognitive decline of the old population, but not enough is known about its consequences and implications. The major challenge is insufficient measures of one's cognition in most survey data. The objective of the paper is to estimate a cognitive proxy from a survey response. Note that taking a survey requires a series of cognitive tasks. I propose a standardized measure of characterizing responses to open-ended financial questions. The resulting proxy shows appealing characteristics and aligns with the cognitive measures directly available in the Health and Retirement Study. I apply the method to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and the proxy performs similarly.
