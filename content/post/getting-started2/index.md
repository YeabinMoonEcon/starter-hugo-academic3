title: Effects of Entry Economic Conditions on the Career of Economics Ph.D.

summary: This paper examines the answering behavior of the old respondents. There is a growing interest in the cognitive decline of the aging population, but not enough is known about the consequences and implications of cognitive decline or its manageability from public policies outside the medical literature. The major challenge is insufficient measures of one’s cognition even in popular surveys such as Consumer Expenditure Survey. The objective of the paper is to create the individual proxy from each respondent’s answering behavior in the survey data. Note that taking a survey requires a series of cognitive tasks. Respondents need to comprehend the question, search their memory, make a decision, and format the response to a given scale. This paper proposes a standardized measure of answering behavior using open-ended financial questions in the Health and Retirement Study. I estimate the proxy of one’s cognitive ability based on one’s answering behavior and try to make it cross-sectionally comparable. The measures are in line with the respondents’ cognitive score in the HRS.
