\section{Job Market Paper}
	 \href{https://www.yeabinmoon.com/uploads/JMP.pdf}{Effects of Entry Economic Conditions on the Career of Economics Ph.D.}\\
	 \textit{abstract}: I estimate the effect of entry economic conditions on the careers of economics Ph.D. from the top 32 programs in the U.S. graduated between 2004 and 2012. The analysis is performed on the novel data science methods of web scraping and natural language processing for fuzzy string matching based on a statistical learning approach. Exploiting the almost complete employment histories of the economists, I build the model based on task-specific human capital theory to examine the possible mechanisms driving the permanent effect on their careers caused by the entry conditions. I empirically test the model’s predictions and find that the entry conditions would cause the occupational mismatch at graduation. Poor entry conditions are associated with a decreased probability of getting a full-time position in R1 university in the U.S. both in the short run and long run. I also find the entry conditions are associated with a fewer number of journal publications over the career. The primary mechanism through which graduates have a permanent effect is immobility across occupations.
